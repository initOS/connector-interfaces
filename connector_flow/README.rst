Connector-Flow
==============

This module provides a minimal framework for task flows based on the OpenERP
Connector.  Tasks can be chained into task flows.

Every flow must a have a unique start.  A task can trigger several successor
tasks.

The module adds a new menu item "Import/Export" under the "Connector"
top-level menu where tasks and task flows can be configured.  Tasks can be run
from the "Run Task" wizard.  If a task needs a file as input, that file can be
uploaded in the wizard.

The *connector_flow_example_{ftp,product}* modules provide pre-configured
demo flows.

This module was definitely inspired by the works of Akretion (file_repository)
and Camptocamp (connector_file).
